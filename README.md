Vercel function which generates PDFs from Webpages.

</div>

## üëã Introduction

This repo contains the code for a simple [Vercel](https://vercel.com) function which generates a PDF file from any webpage using a [headless Chrome instance](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).

## üöÄ Get started

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBetaHuhn%2Fvercel-pdf-converter)

### Or setup manually:

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BetaHuhn/vercel-pdf-converter
```

Install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Login to your Vercel account and setup a project:

```sh
vercel
```

Run the function locally:

```sh
npm run develop
```

Deploy to Vercel in production:

```sh
npm run deploy 
```

## üìö Usage

After you've deployed the function, you can use it by placing your function's domain infront of any URL:

```
to-pdf.vercel.app/https://github.com/BetaHuhn/vercel-pdf-converter
```

The function will then generate a PDF of that URL and return it as a downloadable file.

Here is how this GitHub Page looks as a PDF:
