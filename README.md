## üëã Introduction

This repo contains the code for a simple [Vercel](https://vercel.com) function which generates a PDF file from any webpage using a [headless Chrome instance](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).

## üöÄ Get started

Clone the [vercel-pdf-converter](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/vercel-pdf-converter) repo and run:
```shell
npm run deploy
```

## üìö Usage

After you've deployed the function, you can use it by placing your function's domain infront of any url:

```
your-domain.vercel.app/https://github.com/BetaHuhn/vercel-pdf-converter
```

The function will then generate a PDF of that URL and return it as a downloadable file.
